# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

I used a PID controller to control a car self-driving around a closed track in simulation, the final video I recorded shown as below.

Here is the video YouTube link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBSaH-tncgo&feature=youtu.be

Term **P** is proportional to the current value of the offset from center of the road. For example, if the offset of car is large and positive, the control output will be proportionately large and positive. It turns the car in the right direction to drive on the track. Using proportional control alone in a process with compensation will result in an error between the setpoint and the actual process value, because it requires an error to generate the proportional response. If there is no error, there is no corrective response.

Term **I** accounts for past values of the offset and integrates them over time to produce the *I* term. For example, if there is a residual offset after the application of proportional control, the integral term seeks to eliminate the residual offset by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the offset. When the offset is eliminated, the integral term will stop grow. This will result in the proportional effect diminishing as the offset decreases, but this is compensated for by the growing integral effect.

Term **D** is a best estimate of the future trend of the offset, based on its current rate of change. It can prevent overshooting. It is sometimes called "anticipatory control", as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the offset by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.

Here I tuned the PID coefficients manually, basically use the method mentioned in the class. Just increse or decrese the three coefficients for a small value, and check the result of the car performance improved or not every time. I first tuned P coefficient to get the direction of the car correctlly, then I tuned D coefficient to prevent the overshooting, finally I tuned I coefficient to eliminate the residual offset. The final coefficients are P: -0.17, I: -0.007, D: -1.5.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
